### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. I was able to re-enforce my skills using CSS Grid. The ability to read directly from the ```<div class="display"></div>``` using the display.innertext was very useful and evaluating it and solving the equation was very cool.I really enjoyed changing the theme of the site with JavaScript. This is a great project for polishing your skills in JavaScript.   


### Continued development

Defiantly want to work on more projects like this one. I like writing code in JavaScript and want to continue getting better at it. I would enjoy adding PHP and mySQL to this project. It would be nice to be able to store the results and retrieve them later for future use.
